# Future Components Ideas Overview

## Overview
This document outlines potential future components to be integrated within the library. This is not a formal documentation but an idea roadmap to remind future development plans. The components mentioned here are intended to expand the capabilities of the core library and will include detailed documentation once developed.

## Proposed Future Components

1. **Error Handler Component**
    - **Purpose:**  
      To centralize error, warning, and informational logging across all modules.
    - **Details:**
        - Unifies error codes using prefixes that indicate both type and location (user-side: `eu`, server-side: `es`, network: `en`).
        - Maintains a separate log for informational progress events (i1, i2, etc., up to the last 100 entries).
        - Allows categorization of issues (e.g., unsupported file types trigger an auto-notification and prompt the user).
    - **Reason:**  
      Centralized error management simplifies debugging and ensures consistency across file processing, server operations, and future components.

2. **Authentication Module**
    - **Purpose:**  
      Handle user login, registration, and secure session management.
    - **Reason:**  
      Critical for server operations and integration into broader applications requiring secure access.

3. **Encryption Module**
    - **Purpose:**  
      Provide encryption functionality for files using various algorithms (e.g., AES-256, RSA).
    - **Details:**
        - Integrates easily via a plugin system.
        - Initially accepts file, encryption type, and key.
        - Future parameters may include Initialization Vector (IV) and salt.
    - **Reason:**  
      To enhance security for sensitive file storage and transmission.

4. **Password Manager / Hash Manager**
    - **Purpose:**  
      Manage password storage and retrieval using secure hashing.
    - **Reason:**  
      Useful for bolstering authentication modules and overall server security.

5. **Network Security Module**
    - **Purpose:**  
      Enhance secure communications between servers and clients.
    - **Details:**
        - Options for secure file transfers and encrypted messaging.
        - Plans for integrating TLS and audit logging for network events.
    - **Reason:**  
      Ensures the overall safety of server operations and external communications.

6. **Dynamic Plugin Installer**
    - **Purpose:**  
      Allow users to download and locally register additional compression algorithms or components.
    - **Reason:**  
      Provides flexibility to extend functionality without redeploying the entire system.

## Example JSON Template for the Entire Library
This template can be used to configure the overall system settings and will eventually be extended to support new modules.
```json
{
  "librarySettings": {
      "authenticationEnabled": true,
      "encryptionEnabled": false,
      "compressionModule": {
          "defaultAlgorithm": "LZMA",
          "supportedFileTypes": ["zip", "mp4", "txt", "jpg"],
          "pluginSupport": true
      },
      "errorHandling": {
          "logLevel": "detailed",
          "maxInfoEntries": 100
      }
  }
}
```
